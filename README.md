# assembler
Final project of Architecture of Computers written in assembler for PIC16F886.

The program is specifically written to be run on the USB PIC School, but it would also run on a PIC 16F886 connected to a numerical keyboard (Arduino type), a LCD 1602 screen and a interruption generator such a clock or a button.
This project consists of a program written in assembler code. It generates 4 number sequences (Fibonacci, even numbers, Padovan and powers of two) and stores them in the GPR of the PIC 16F886. 
The program allows the user to see the name of the author and select a sequence which the numerical keyboard. This sequence is displayed on a 1602 LCD screen.
